# Datatrics PHP API client
This package is a convenience wrapper to communicate with the Datatrics REST-API

## Installation
For the installation of the client, there are 2 ways. The composer way is preferable, but not always possible.

### Composer
Include the package in your `composer.json` file
``` json
{
    "require": {
        "datatrics/php-api": "2.0.x-dev"
    }
}
```

...then run `composer update` and load the composer autoloader:

``` php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// ...
```

### Manual
Obtain the latest version of the Datatrics PHP API client
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Datatrics/php-api
```

And include the class in your project
``` php
require_once '/path/to/Client.php';
```

## Usage
There are a lot of API resources that are accessible through this client. You can look them up by looking at the code. Their name matches the name in the documentation(https://doc-beta.datatrics.com).

``` php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Client('[api-key]', '[project-id]');

$project = $client->Project->Get('[project-id]');
```

__Explanation__

[api-key]
The API key you've received or created

[project-id]
id of the project
